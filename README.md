# Quantum-adders
Quantum implementation of reversible adders (Half, full, ripple-carry) using Qiskit

This repository contains quantum implementations of reversible adders using Qiskit, including:
- Half Adder
- Full Adder
- n-bit Ripple-Carry Adder
You can create visions on **Quirk** and translated into **Qiskit** circuits.
## Goals
- understand reversible arithmetic
- Translate Quirk circuits into Qiskit
- Build scalable n-bit quantum adders
- Have hands on work with the quantum set up and quantum logic
## Tech
- Python
- Qiskit
- Quirk (for visualization)
